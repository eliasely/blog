That's my very first post, and I don't expect many people to read it. This is mostly for me, to get back in a couple years, and hopefully measure some progress.

There are a few reasons I am starting this blog:
* I love sharing but I never found the right place to do so. So this blog is my own place where I can share.
* AI is getting everywhere, and people are getting super lazy because of it. I don’t want to lose my brain or my ability to do things because of AI tools.
* I want to demystify things that not many people would look at using simple terms. I firmly believe you can't share something you don't understand. Isn't one of Einstein's misattributed quote [1]: _"If you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough"_.
* I want to stay hungry and stay foolish [2].
